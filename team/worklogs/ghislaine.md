## 2023-07-11

Yesterday, I identified a variety of use cases from the Syften posts that contained keywords we were tracking. I then transformed these into a set of structured [use cases](https://hackmd.io/wC38kFL-Q6mR2TJR2_ZCEw?view).

Following this, I reviewed them with Kriti and we collectively decided on our next steps. Our upcoming task is to aggregate all the identified information into these use cases. The goal is to understand what's blocking Mathesar from serving these users effectively.

At this stage, we aren't making any decisions about which use cases to work on. However, the intention is to generate a broad map of what's out there in terms of competing solutions. This will aid us in understanding where we are best suited to fill out those gaps.

I'm focused in:
- Creating the use cases table for the user research project

## 2023-07-10

I've gone through Syften notifications, reading through the different posts extracting user needs. Started categorizing them and will now focus in different use cases. 

I'm focused in:
- Writing the first user research report draft

## 2023-07-07

I am continuining work with the research project, which basically involves going through freshdesk and capturing any relevant feeedback, categorizing it and finding patterns. 

Had a call with Kriti to define the goals and deliverables for the user research project.

I'm focused in:
- Writing the first user research report draft

## 2023-07-06

In preparation for the user feedback project I am going through all the unread Freshdesk tickets and collecting the different user needs into a document.
