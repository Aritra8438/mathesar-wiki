## 2023-07-10

I've gone through Syften notifications, reading through the different posts extracting user needs. Started categorizing them and will now focus in different use cases. 

I'm focused in:
- Writing the first user research report draft

## 2023-07-07

I am continuining work with the research project, which basically involves going through freshdesk and capturing any relevant feeedback, categorizing it and finding patterns. 

Had a call with Kriti to define the goals and deliverables for the user research project.

I'm focused in:
- Writing the first user research report draft

## 2023-07-06

In preparation for the user feedback project I am going through all the unread Freshdesk tickets and collecting the different user needs into a document.
