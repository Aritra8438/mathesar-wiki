## Tasks

- Be on the marketing@mathesar.org mailing list.
    - This list receives the “firehose” of Syften notifications, including all mentions of competitors and people looking for “spreadsheet-like” solutions.
- Handle Syften notifications
    - If Mathesar is mentioned, eagerly reply to to threads as needed, seeking to ameliorate people’s concerns and amplify people’s excitement.
    - If a problem that Mathesar could be used to solve is mentioned, then suggest using Mathesar in a tactful way.
        - Our goal here should not be to shoehorn Mathesar into all sorts of use cases. Instead, we should be on the lookout only for cases that Mathesar is a good solution for.
    - For the time being, Kriti should review any Reddit / Hacker News responses before they go out. This is not a long term solution, but there might be things that she knows that other people don’t know.
        - Eventually, we should create an “evangelism guide” ([example](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/social-media/))
    - If someone tweets about Mathesar, we should re-tweet it from our account and/or thank them for the shoutout.
- Forward noteworthy publicity to the rest of the team as needed (probably a post in the Matrix Marketing channel is enough)
- Track notable publicity for archival purposes on our [Marketing History](./marketing/history.md)
- Make progress on our [Mathesar launch publicity checklist](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-website/issues/78)
    - We’ll hold off on making new announcements until our installation process is improved
    - We should continue to add Mathesar to aggregators, though.
- Do research on more relevant aggregators that Mathesar could be added to and add them there.
- Keep track of where we’re getting traffic from (using GitHub Insights and our analytics), and track notable sources in the [Marketing History](./marketing/history.md) page
- If we need to improve messaging on Mathesar.org based on user feedback, make a proposal to Kriti outlining the problem and proposed changes.
