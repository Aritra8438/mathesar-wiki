# Team

| Role | Assignees |
|-|-|
| **Owner** | Dominykas |
| **Candidate greeter/helper** | Anish, Rajat |

# Guide
This section serves as a handbook for people working on these responsibilities. The notes section hold, among other things, a [calendar](#Calendar) with various deadlines and tasks.

## Everyone
- Enforce a no-early-issue-assigns rule during the GSoC proposals phase (ends April 4th)
	- No-early-issue-assigns rule means that a contributor can be assigned to an issue only when he has a PR that reached some kind of completion (merged or killed)
	- Purpose is to maximize the number of issues candidates have available
  - See this [conversation thread](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/mathesar.org/g/core-team/c/hFU729n8xDE) for the edge case this opens up where multiple PRs for the same issue compete to be merged

## All members
- Perform greet/help daily
  - Greet, meaning notice new contributors and greet them
  - Help, meaning respond to requests for help
	- See [greet/help schedule](#Greethelp-schedule) section
 	- See [greet/help](#Greethelp-instructions) instructions section
## Owner
- Be an org admin for GSoC
- Be extremely familiar with the GSoC program, including
	- [GSoC mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/)
	- All our [Mentoring](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mentoring) documentation and policies
- Keep an eye on any GSoC related emails and action items, and ensure the rest of the team completes any action items.
- Keep an eye on GSoC related deadlines and timelines.
- Monitor GSoC draft applications and ensure they all get reviewed in a timely manner.
	- Follow up with other team members as needed.
- Facilitate a process of selecting GSoC students and projects once final applications are in.
	- e.g. see [this spreadsheet from last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SAgETOHvNnVf-MBUqe_WLbOLsl8qDax35DOukaUueO8/edit#gid=1794943298).
- Keep track of comments on new issues and assign issues to people when they ask.
	- The rest of the team should mostly be doing this, but itâ€™s good to keep an eye on it.
- Keep track of issues that have already been assigned and un-assign them after 7 days of inactivity.
	- Anish is doing this, but itâ€™s good to keep an eye on this.
	- https://github.com/orgs/centerofci/projects/1/views/42 may be helpful, it sorts by last activity.
- Follow up on requests from GSoC (e.g. filling out forms about impact of GSoC on Mathesar), since it builds goodwill
- Ensure there are enough open issues for GSoC contributors to work on OR revise the applicant guide to remove the contribution requirement and come up with an alternate way to evaluate candidates (maybe have a standard backend and frontend task for everyone).
- Generally keep an eye on GSoC process efficiency and make improvements to processes or documentation as needed.

# Notes & Resources
## Greet/help instructions

### Greeting

Suggested process:

1. Notice new contributors
	- In Matrix, check the little visualizations above and below messages of new people joining to see who is new
2. Welcome them, whether they're active or engage first or not
3. Preemptively remind them of our resources for self-guidance:
  - the [applicant guide](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mentoring/applicant-guide)
  - or, the [contributing guide](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/contributing)
4. Having provided a resource for self-guidance, encourage them to speak up if something is not clear.

Example in our Matrix General channel:

>`Welcome @practicat, @Joangie Marquez, @Mayank Arya, @shantanu oak, @krishav ðŸ‘‹ If you're here for GSoC, don't forget to check out our [GSoC candidate  guide](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mentoring/applicant-guide). If something is not clear, reach out!`

### Helping

A few things to keep in mind

- Be on the watch for problems that might affect a lot of people, or few people but gravely
- Don't do new contributors' work for them
- Don't be dismissive either
- Refer them to resources for self-guidance (namely our applicant or contributing guides)
- Politely remind of our expectation that contributors will be relatively self-sufficient and tolerant of minimal hand-holding

## Greet/help schedule

We aim to greet and help new contributors (mostly GSoC candidates) multiple times per day (between all of us, not each). This schedule should act as *a very rough guide*, in practice we'll often respond whenever we see a new message, but in case that's inconvenient, use this schedule as a guide for when to perform this task.

| Member | Approximate time |
|-|-|
| Dominykas | UTC 11:00 |
| Anish | UTC 4:30 |
| Rajat | UTC 4:30 |

## Office hours

Office hours are public sync meetings we host where community members (GSoC candidates mostly) join to get help. Previous year such meetings only received community participation just before the end of the proposal period. We're currently planning to host these only during the last week of the proposal period.

We track community events, including office hours, [on this Wiki page](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/events) and GSoC-related events in our [GSoC Calendar](#Calendar).

## Calendar

[This Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_5a779de8f9e054a645c11926302c1222e4d81aa85c126c84eb23ef056d9b9408%40group.calendar.google.com) is used to track GSoC-related deadlines and related tasks.

## Periodic review of ability to evaluate proposals

Scheduled in the [calendar](#Calendar). This thread tracks results of these reviews: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2733
