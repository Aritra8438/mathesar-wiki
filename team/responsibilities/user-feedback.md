## All Team Members
All team members are encouraged to actively participate in the feedback process, regardless of their assigned roles. This includes flagging or sharing user feedback that they come across during their interactions with Mathesar's users or while monitoring various channels.

## Owner

- Monitor the "hello@mathesar.org" email, following up with users as needed.
- Document and organize user feedback from all channels, making it easily accessible on the [User Feedback HackMD page](https://hackmd.io/team/user-feedback).
- Categorize collected feedback using appropriate tags and attributes.
- Create surveys and call scripts to improve the feedback collection process.
- Manage and maintain additional channels for user feedback, such as roadmaps, user guides, and blogs.

## Call Assistance Helpers

During feedback calls, helpers can play an active role in supporting the conversation by taking detailed notes, asking follow-up questions, and providing input from various perspectives, such as technical or user experience.

## Identifying Feedback

### What counts as feedback:
- User experiences: Feedback describing Mathesar's usability, performance, or overall satisfaction.
- Feature requests: Suggestions for new features or improvements addressing specific user needs.
- Pain points: Issues or challenges faced by users while using Mathesar.
- Competitor comparisons: Instances where users compare Mathesar to other tools or solutions.
- Misconceptions or confusion: Indications of user misunderstandings about Mathesar's functionality, purpose, or usage.

### What doesn't count as feedback:
- Technical support: Questions or issues resolved through troubleshooting, bug fixes, or guidance on using Mathesar.
- Non-constructive criticism: Vague or unfounded complaints without context or specific details (e.g., "There are already many tools like this," "I don't like it")
