## Helpers Guide

### Flagging User Feedback
Helpers in this project should watch for relevant feedback and flag it accordingly. For example:

#### From GitHub Issues
Flag issues opened by users seeking help that might prevent them from fully benefiting from Mathesar. Focus on following up with users who may abandon Mathesar due to the problem.

#### From Social Channels (Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, etc.)
Track instances where users express dissatisfaction, satisfaction, or interest in using Mathesar across various social channels.

#### From Mathesar Team Channels (Matrix, Discord, Mailing Lists etc.)
Ensure to mention the project owner when user feedback arises in discussions within official team channels.

### Assistance During Feedback Calls

During feedback calls, helpers can play an active role in supporting the conversation by taking detailed notes, asking follow-up questions, and providing input from various perspectives, such as technical or user experience.
