## Tasks

- Decide what goes in each release
- Decide when to release
- Publish each release, delegating tasks as needed
- Keep the team informed so that everyone knows the correct release to target with new tickets and new PRs
- Document our release process and support the team with questions about it
- Document our git branch strategy and support the team with questions about it
- Keep our broader goals and strategies in-mind, potentially planning multiple major/minor/point releases ahead.
- Decide when to update the staging and demo servers and delegate that work as needed
