# 2022-08-04 Data Modeling & Schemas

**Topic**: Resolve product and design questions for Brent's upcoming work  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Ghislaine, Brent

## Data modeling suggestions

["Suggest Candidate Columns to Create Separate Table" internship report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16BSTdr5B7NDGzgKI6oh2LQ_D4Jad5JvD/view)

### Questions

- Better to extract too few columns or too many?
- How fiddly should the feedback loop of deciding which columns to extract be?
- Brent's proposed process:
    - Suggest set of columns to extract
    - Explain to user why those are useful
    - User adds or removes columns
    - Analyze in second round

- Alternate process (more manual):
    - Have the user guide more of the column extraction


### Discussion
- Brent's first proposed process is preferable from a UX perspective, having the user make repeated decisions is not ideal
    - Second round is not necessary, let's stick to one round.
- It's better to be conservative with suggestions, better to suggest fewer columns than potentially unrelated data
- Eventually explore ProbComp integration
- Number / Date & Time (non-categorical data) should be avoided during suggestions, since it's too risky and will involve additional statistical analysis to get right
    - Not even if they're directly correlated to categorical data columns (e.g. if there's a person's name and birthday, we only suggest name, not birthday)
    - Brent will check for easy wins if there's not too much effort involved

## Schema homepage
- Schemas will now have descriptions, stored in DB comments
    - Mathesar won't own the description, other clients can edit it
    - UX should make it clear that this data can be edited outside of Mathesar (maybe mention that it's stored as a DB comment)
- We should also do this for tables and columns at the same time, since it's a very similar implementation
- We can easily get the count for both Mathesar-specific data like Explorations and for DB objects
    - We can be more precise with DB objects

# 2022-08-04 Table Inspector meeting

**Topic**: Resolve major questions remaining before finalizing the [table inspector spec](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar-wiki/pull/51)  
**Attendees**: Ghislaine, Kriti, Sean, Rajat

## Spec Overview
We took a quick look at the current spec and content.

## Selection Modes
- Do we agree or have any concerns with the proposed selection modes?
    - Selection triggers might not be the best way to trigger inspector modes. 
    - A tabbed panel that groups properties by level (table, column, record, cell) might be better.
    - Column and Row information will be derived from selected cells.
    - The selection status would change based on active tab

- Are we planning to provide keyboard and touch device interactions for selections in this cycle?
    - No

## Contextual Menus and Inspector Interactions
- Will the user be able to trigger the inspector panel via contextual menu actions?
    - Yes, but will not be part of Cycle 3.
    - We discussed the concept of adding an option like "Show Column Properties" in the inspector to open it with a chosen tab.
- Do we need to incorporate contextual menu actions into the spec?
    - Not for this cycle.

We want to do this, but not in Cycle 3.

## Defining Actions and the Actions Panel
- Do we agree with the proposed use of actions to represent data transformation or modeling tasks?
    - Yes, we agreed
    - We need to make sure actions are consistent, e.g. Set to NULL is probably a property because it's related to the cell value

## Ways to Enable Inspector
- Do we agree or have any concerns with the proposed inspector states and triggers?
    - Not selection triggered
    - User can toggle

## Decisions
Out of Scope (for this spec / Cycle 3)
- Context menu changes for opening the inspector
- Keyboard and touch interactions
- Selecting disjoint cells and columns (will defer to keyboard interactions)

## Reference
### Sean's proposed "Cell-only selection"

For the sake of brainstorming, I present a rough design which unifies the selection behavior for cells, rows, and columns. I'm not attached to this design, but rather putting it forward to demonstrate an alternate approach that may lead to even better design ideas collaboratively.
    
- Cells can be selected -- but rows and columns cannot.
- Multiple cells can be selected via the same UX as LibreOffice Calc. Clicking on a row/column header selects all the cells within the row/column.
- As with LibreOffice Calc, the row/column headers visually indicate which rows and columns contain the current selection.
- When at least one cell is selected, an "Actions" sidebar appears on the right.
- The Actions sidebar can be hidden and re-shown by clicking on arrows. Its visibility state persists in local storage.
- If the actions sidebar is hidden, then all cells have a context menu which shows the contents of the actions sidebar. Opening the context menu from a selected cell maintains the current selection. Opening the context menu from an un-selected cell changes the selection to contain only that cell.
- The actions sidebar contains collapsible sections for "Cells", "Rows", and "Columns". Each section heading also displays the number of entities currently selected, e.g. "Cells (3)".
- The "Cells" section contains actions like "Set to NULL", "Set to DEFAULT", "Set to Now", "Copy Down", "Copy", "Paste" and other actions depending on type.
- The "Rows" section contains actions like "Delete", "Duplicate"
- The "Columns" section contains all the UI currently in the column header menu, plus the new UI for extracting columns.
- To aid in the discoverability and usability of selecting multiple cells in nonadjacent blocks, the Actions sidebar also contains a button labelled "Grow Selection" which displays above the Cell/Row/Column sections. When the user clicks "Grow Selection", the button visually pulses indicating that a special (and persistent) mode has been enabled, and the user can select cells as they would with `Ctrl` pressed in LibreOffice Calc. A help message also displays below the button when grow-selection mode is enabled.




# 2022-08-03 Cycle 3 check-in

## Check in on everyone's work

### Brent
- Was blocked on summarization until today, unblocked now
- Made progress on setting up library dataset, pretty much done
    - Not sure if it works on Windows, but that's not relevant for Cycle 3
- Reviewed Maria's work for Data Modeling Suggestions
    - Meeting with Kriti & Ghislaine tomorrow to discuss product work
- Schema homepage on backburner since it's quick

### Dhruvi
- Data Import work is moving along
    - Deliverable will be a spec

### Dominykas
- Filtering almost done, need to meet with Pavish
    - Will be scheduled soon
- Dynamic Defaults
    - Thinking about implementation constraints
    - Will meet with Kriti and/or Ghislaine to discuss product concerns this week

### Ghislaine
- Navigation spec should be merged today
- Table Inspector
    - Draft of spec ready
    - Need to meet with Rajat and Sean about deliverable
- Column Extraction
    - depends on table inspector, will need separate spec
- Schema Page
    - not yet started
- Styling
    - not yet started, hopefully this week

### Mukesh
- Column Extraction pretty much done, awaiting final review from Brent
- Record Summary backend work is close as well
- Record Summary frontend work is not yet started, will take up the rest of the week

### Pavish
- Data Explorer will occupy time until next meeting, including Filtering
- Grouping & summarization in Data Explorer are next
- Data Import has not been started

### Rajat
- Currently working on introductory tasks, making progress
- Next task: Table Inspector
    - Read spec
    - Meet with Ghislaine & Sean

### Sean
- Need to resolve Navigation work assignment (see next agenda item)
- Record Selector work is moving along
- Record Page has not been started yet, would be good to do after Navigation

## Navigation work

Difficult for Sean to coordinate with Pavish due to TZs. Navigation work seems to involve fiddly modifications of lots of code that Pavish originally wrote, thus it would be quicker with coordination.

### Options
- Sean and Pavish find a better meeting time (difficult)
- Pavish takes navigation, give some work to Sean in return

### Decision
- Sean and Pavish will meet and discuss in a separate call

## Renaming Queries to Explorations in the UI

Thumbs up all around

## Data Import work
- Design constraint: 
    - We want to make sure that the user understands that they cannot navigate away from the page during the import process.
    - A modal is one way to do this, but it's just a suggestion
- It will significantly simplify code on the frontend if we can stop portraying import as asynchronous like we've been doing
- We discussed rethinking the import flow to allow the user to having more stopping points in the import process since it's synchronous
    - they can see the files they've uploaded
    - they can decide to import a specific file into a table
    - they can control the inference process and whether/when it happens
- We decided not to rethink the flow since it complicates Cycle 3 work and is irrelevant to our use case. 
- We will need to update the import flow to account for importing data into existing tables (Anish's work), so we can think through all this then.
