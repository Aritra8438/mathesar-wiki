# 2022-08-03 Cycle 3 check-in

## Check in on everyone's work

### Brent
- Was blocked on summarization until today, unblocked now
- Made progress on setting up library dataset, pretty much done
    - Not sure if it works on Windows, but that's not relevant for Cycle 3
- Reviewed Maria's work for Data Modeling Suggestions
    - Meeting with Kriti & Ghislaine tomorrow to discuss product work
- Schema homepage on backburner since it's quick

### Dhruvi
- Data Import work is moving along
    - Deliverable will be a spec

### Dominykas
- Filtering almost done, need to meet with Pavish
    - Will be scheduled soon
- Dynamic Defaults
    - Thinking about implementation constraints
    - Will meet with Kriti and/or Ghislaine to discuss product concerns this week

### Ghislaine
- Navigation spec should be merged today
- Table Inspector
    - Draft of spec ready
    - Need to meet with Rajat and Sean about deliverable
- Column Extraction
    - depends on table inspector, will need separate spec
- Schema Page
    - not yet started
- Styling
    - not yet started, hopefully this week

### Mukesh
- Column Extraction pretty much done, awaiting final review from Brent
- Record Summary backend work is close as well
- Record Summary frontend work is not yet started, will take up the rest of the week

### Pavish
- Data Explorer will occupy time until next meeting, including Filtering
- Grouping & summarization in Data Explorer are next
- Data Import has not been started

### Rajat
- Currently working on introductory tasks, making progress
- Next task: Table Inspector
    - Read spec
    - Meet with Ghislaine & Sean

### Sean
- Need to resolve Navigation work assignment (see next agenda item)
- Record Selector work is moving along
- Record Page has not been started yet, would be good to do after Navigation

## Navigation work

Difficult for Sean to coordinate with Pavish due to TZs. Navigation work seems to involve fiddly modifications of lots of code that Pavish originally wrote, thus it would be quicker with coordination.

### Options
- Sean and Pavish find a better meeting time (difficult)
- Pavish takes navigation, give some work to Sean in return

### Decision
- Sean and Pavish will meet and discuss in a separate call

## Renaming Queries to Explorations in the UI

Thumbs up all around

## Data Import work
- Design constraint: 
    - We want to make sure that the user understands that they cannot navigate away from the page during the import process.
    - A modal is one way to do this, but it's just a suggestion
- It will significantly simplify code on the frontend if we can stop portraying import as asynchronous like we've been doing
- We discussed rethinking the import flow to allow the user to having more stopping points in the import process since it's synchronous
    - they can see the files they've uploaded
    - they can decide to import a specific file into a table
    - they can control the inference process and whether/when it happens
- We decided not to rethink the flow since it complicates Cycle 3 work and is irrelevant to our use case. 
- We will need to update the import flow to account for importing data into existing tables (Anish's work), so we can think through all this then.
