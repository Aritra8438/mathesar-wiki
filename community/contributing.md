We welcome contributions of all kinds to Mathesar!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. See the [Community](/community) page for how to find us.

# Code
Mathesar's development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar). If you are not familiar with GitHub or pull requests, please follow [GitHub's "Hello World" guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) first.

You may also want to visit our [Engineering](/engineering) page to learn more about our development process.

## Finding an Issue
You can find an issue to work on from our [issues page](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues).
  - Unassigned issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` are especially tagged for contributors.
    - [Issues tagged `good first issue`](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
    - [Issues tagged `help wanted`](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
  - Unassigned issues tagged `status: ready` are also fair game.

If you want to work on something for which there is no GitHub issue open yet, create an issue and propose your change there. A Mathesar [team member](/team) will evaluate your issue and decide whether we'll accept a pull request for the issue. If we indicate that we will accept a PR, then go ahead and start work on it.

## Joining the Community
It would be helpful for you to join the "General" channel on our [Matrix server](/community/matrix) and introduce yourself. You can ask any questions about the project or finding issues here as well.

You may also want to join the [`mathesar-developers` mailing list](/community/mailing-lists). The team uses it to discuss new features and send updates to everyone working on the project.

## Contributing
Once you've found an issue to work on, 

- Comment on it and say you'd like to work on that issue. This is so we can keep track of who is interested in each issue.
- Write your code and submit your pull request. Be sure to read and follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
- Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.

## Code Review
We encourage and appreciate code review by contributors. Feel free to review any open pull requests. Follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
