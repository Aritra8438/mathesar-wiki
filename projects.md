## How we use projects

- We chunk our work into projects to keep it organized.
- Unlike [ongoing work](/team/responsibilities.md), each project has an end date.
- Each project has one and only leader.
- Projects typically have a few helpers too. The project leader can delegate work to the helpers. The helpers can serve as code reviewers too.
