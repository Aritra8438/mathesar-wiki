Collection of notable feedback gathered in March 2023.

## Installation
> Looks fantastic, will def give this a go when a .deb or flatpak happens.

> I tried to install this last week and after a couple attempts I had to abandon. I'd really love to try this but that interactive installer is terrible.
> > I don't remember the exact error I was getting, but I know it failed every time and I had to start the interactive installer again every single time, making it extremely tedious.
> >
> > I think it's just better to provide a docker-compose file with default values, document all options and let the user set it up as they want.

> Please, why do we need to read through your bash script to figure out what it does when you could just provide a docker-compose.yml file?
>
> I found this one https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml but since it is not mentioned in the docs, I need to read through and see what I can remove from it like I don't need caddy or watchtower and see if I can get it to work. I see it contains 3 profiles :-( way too complicated for trying right now.
> > Thanks, I will follow your progress. I get your idea, but before I run a bash scrip off the internet, I need to check what it does and that is a pain in the a** if you don't use bash regularly. Lots of googling, checking what the next line of the script does, etc.

## Connecting Mathesar to existing DBs
> This is pure madness. Maybe for an office with 4 employees the blast radius is small enough - otherwise it's the pinnacle of thoughtless democratization of data inevitably resulting in anarchy. 

## Demo
> This is timely as I'm in the market for tools like this.
>
> However: Demo login account not working :(

> This looks really good, I like that you always leave the database clean so devs and non-devs are seeing the exact same thing essentially.
> 
> I tried the demo but after creating a schema and starting to add tables I just got blank pages with "stream timeout" and "upstream request timeout". Trouble started when I tried to rename a table, it spun on 'saving' for ages then a message popped up about a bad response from the server. After that nothing would load. I hope I didn't break it. Maybe it's just too popular!
>> Thanks, it's working now and seems a bit faster too.

## Developer experience

> Does it have API and SDKs?
> > You could generate it using swagger or similar I think, so that we have an automatic js sdk to query/update tables and so on.

## Other products
> Any benefits over Metabase?
>
> We use it it let buiness guys look into DB, visualize stuff.

## General or multiple topics
> Neat project, looks clean too! Definitely times in the past that I could have done with a web-based DB explorer that's more data-exploration focused and intuitive like this rather than being an admin-tool first. Best of luck with it!

> Tried and looks solid.personally i don't like of database list , it should be better with grid of cards , instead of single column.
> I think quality and feature completeness surpassed BaseRow or NocoDB. Which are already tauted as production , I think you guys are good for atleast beta tag.
> > More people will use on beta tag , so it will lead to more testers. 

> Please post to r/python too since this in django.
>> Also please post to /r/selfhosted

> Nice, confidence is high that this is a Galaxy Quest reference.
>> I love it!
>>
>> Never give up, never surrender.
