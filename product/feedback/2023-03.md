Collection of notable feedback gathered in March 2023.

## Installation
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/11mw9u1/mathesar_slaps_a_webbased_spreadsheet_ui_on_your/jbm7hg8/): *Looks fantastic, will def give this a go when a .deb or flatpak happens.* 

## Connecting Mathesar to existing DBs
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/11mw9u1/mathesar_slaps_a_webbased_spreadsheet_ui_on_your/jbl3vri/): *This is pure madness. Maybe for an office with 4 employees the blast radius is small enough - otherwise it's the pinnacle of thoughtless democratization of data inevitably resulting in anarchy.* 

## Demo
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/11mw9u1/mathesar_slaps_a_webbased_spreadsheet_ui_on_your/jbl4xrg/): *This is timely as I'm in the market for tools like this.*

*However: Demo login account not working :(*

## Other products
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/11mw9u1/mathesar_slaps_a_webbased_spreadsheet_ui_on_your/jbn3tdk/): *Any benefits over Metabase?*

*We use it it let buiness guys look into DB, visualize stuff.*

## General
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/11kdb5e/we_just_released_mathesar_an_intuitive_ui_for/jb6nof2/): *Neat project, looks clean too! Definitely times in the past that I could have done with a web-based DB explorer that's more data-exploration focused and intuitive like this rather than being an admin-tool first. Best of luck with it!*
