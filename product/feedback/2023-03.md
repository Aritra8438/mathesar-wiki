Collection of notable feedback gathered in March 2023.

## Installation
> Looks fantastic, will def give this a go when a .deb or flatpak happens.

## Connecting Mathesar to existing DBs
> This is pure madness. Maybe for an office with 4 employees the blast radius is small enough - otherwise it's the pinnacle of thoughtless democratization of data inevitably resulting in anarchy. 

## Demo
> This is timely as I'm in the market for tools like this.
>
> However: Demo login account not working :(

## Other products
> Any benefits over Metabase?
>
> We use it it let buiness guys look into DB, visualize stuff.

## General or multiple topics
> Neat project, looks clean too! Definitely times in the past that I could have done with a web-based DB explorer that's more data-exploration focused and intuitive like this rather than being an admin-tool first. Best of luck with it!

> Tried and looks solid.personally i don't like of database list , it should be better with grid of cards , instead of single column.
> I think quality and feature completeness surpassed BaseRow or NocoDB. Which are already tauted as production , I think you guys are good for atleast beta tag.
> > More people will use on beta tag , so it will lead to more testers. 

> Please post to r/python too since this in django.
>> Also please post to /r/selfhosted
