These are the steps that we follow for creating a new Mathesar release.

# Pre-release
## 1. Designate a release owner
The release owner is in charge of carrying out the steps to create a release and coordinating with the rest of the team as needed.

## 2. Ensure product is release-ready
- In a branch off `master`, update the version number in the repo in  `mathesar/__init__.py`
  - We use semantic versioning. The alpha release of Mathesar will be `0.1.0` and upcoming releases should be `0.1.x` where `x` is incremented.
- Also update the version in `install.sh` if needed.
- Run `install.sh` on the commit you've made and make sure everything works.
- Do a quick smoke test on the product â€“ ensure you can
  - log in
  - create a schema
  - edit records
- Merge the branch to `master`

## 3. Create a tag
- Tag the commit you've just merged with the version number of the release.
- Tags are created at https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/tags. You can also tag locally and push the tag to GitHub.

## 4. Write release notes
- Coordinate with Kriti to write the release notes
- These should be written in Markdown outside of GitHub

# Release process
## 1. Create, tag, and push release Docker images
- Clone a fresh version of the repo.
- `cd` to repository, check out the commit that you've tagged.
- Make sure you're logged into DockerHub (credentials are in 1Password)
- Run the following commands:
  - `docker buildx create --name container --driver=docker-container`
  - `docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-caddy:<version_number> -t mathesar/mathesar-caddy:latest --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -f Dockerfile.caddy .`
    - - Replace `<version_number>` with new version
  - `docker buildx build -t mathesar/mathesar-prod:<version_number> -t mathesar/mathesar-prod:latest --builder=container --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push . --build-arg PYTHON_REQUIREMENTS=requirements-prod.txt`
    - Replace `<version_number>` with new version

## 2. Create release in GitHub
1. Releases are made here: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/releases
2. The release should be associated with the tag you made in the previous step and use the release notes.
