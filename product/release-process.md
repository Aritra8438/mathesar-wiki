These are the steps that we follow for creating a new Mathesar release.

# Pre-release
## 1. Designate a release owner
The release owner is in charge of carrying out the steps to create a release and coordinating with the rest of the team as needed.

## 2. Ensure product is release-ready
- In a branch off `master`, update the version number in the repo in  `mathesar/__init__.py`
  - We use semantic versioning. The alpha release of Mathesar will be `0.1.0` and upcoming releases should be `0.1.x` where `x` is incremented.
- Run `install.sh` on the commit you've made and make sure everything works.
- Do a quick smoke test on the product â€“ ensure you can
  - log in
  - create a schema
  - edit records
- Merge the branch to `master`

## 3. Create a tag
- Tag the commit you've just merged with the version number of the release.
- Tags are created at https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/tags. You can also tag locally and push the tag to GitHub.

## 4. Write release notes
- Coordinate with Kriti to write the release notes
- These should be written in Markdown outside of GitHub

# Release process
## 1. Create release Docker image
*TBD*

## 2. Tag Docker image appropriately
*TBD*

## 3. Push Docker image
*TBD*

## Create release in GitHub
1. Releases are made here: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/releases
2. The release should be associated with the tag you made in the previous step and use the release notes.
