<img src="/mathesar_primary_shaded_hor_rgb.png" width=300px alt="Mathesar logo"/>

Mathesar is a straightforward open source tool that provides a **spreadsheet-like interface** to a PostgreSQL **database**. Our web-based interface helps you and your collaborators work with data more independently and comfortably â€“ **no technical skills needed**.

You can use Mathesar to build **data models**, **enter data**, and even **build reports**. You host your own Mathesar installation, which gives you ownership, privacy, and control of your data.

## Current status
Mathesar is a work in progress. We aim to release our alpha version in February 2023.

## About the wiki
The Mathesar wiki is aimed at **people who are helping build Mathesar**. Please see our [main website](https://mathesar.org) for information about Mathesar aimed at general audiences.
