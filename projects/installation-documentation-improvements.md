## Problem
* Users are trying to use Mathesar with various setups and our installation documentation is lacking information to help them with it
  - Only Docker-based installation is listed in our docs. But [Users want to install Mathesar without using Docker](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35007769)
  - Configuration files don't have enough comments, [preventing users from tinkering.](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2655#issuecomment-1465731661)
  - The installation script is tightly coupled, [preventing them from using it with their own setup](https://hackmd.io/wUpuiOwLRhGDy2y7H-ccHw). The user cannot use the script to do only certain tasks, for example, they cannot use the script to only create a configuration file and skip other steps. 
  - The installation script asks for `sudo` access, [so some users are not comfortable with it](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2761)
  - Users want to use Mathesar with Kubernetes, Nomad etc. Our docker-compose script won't be helpful in such cases

## Solution
- Add Documentation for setting up Mathesar with the Mathesar Service Docker Image
- Add Documentation for installing Mathesar without using install.sh
- Documenting our config files so user can manually edit them
- Documenting setting up Mathesar without Docker
- Documenting upgrades and changes in UI to add instructions for non-docker-compose environments
- Document limitations involved with the installation script.
- Separate docker-compose file for production

## Risks
- There are unknowns with testing since weâ€™re hiring external people, which might affect the timeline.
- Issues uncovered during testing might affect the timeline.

## Resources
- **Issues**: [GitHub meta issue](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2789)

## Timeline
This project should take **2 weeks** and additionally **2 weeks** for testing, so **4 weeks** in total. Testing will start happening in  parallel as soon as a documentation gets completed.
