## Problem
Users have reported wanting to order pizza through Mathesar's UI.

## Solution
- Investigate pizza companies with good APIs.
- Collect address information from users.
- Figure out how to store pizza company API keys in config.
- Check if address can be delivered to using API.
- Figure out what a default pizza should be (e.g. cheese pizza)
- If yes, add "Order Pizza NOW!!!" button to UI.
- When user presses button, order default pizza.

To simplify implementation, we are not going to allow users to customize their pizza yet.

## Risks
- Paying for all these pizzas will cost money.
- Users could be allergic to pizza ingredients.
