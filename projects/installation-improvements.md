**(WIP)**

- **Roles**:
    - **Owner**: Mukesh
    - **Helpers**: Brent, Pavish
- **Status**: Draft
- **Problem**: Our users want to install Mathesar on various infrastructures. They find our current installation script `install.sh` to be pretty limiting.
- **Outcome**: Our installation process will have less number of steps, which will make it easier for Users to install Mathesar without using our `install.sh` script.
- **Solution**: 
	- Move certain installation steps into the Mathesar UI.
- **Timeline**: TODO
- **Issues**: 
- **Themes**: User Experience and growth
