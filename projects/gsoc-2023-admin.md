## Periodic review of ability to evaluate proposals

Scheduled in the calendar. This thread tracks results of these reviews: https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/2733

## Responsibilities

- Be an org admin for GSoC
- Be extremely familiar with the GSoC program, including
    - [GSoC mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/)
    - All our [Mentoring](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mentoring) documentation and policies
- Keep an eye on any GSoC related emails and action items, and ensure the rest of the team completes any action items.
- Keep an eye on GSoC related deadlines and timelines.
- Monitor GSoC draft applications and ensure they all get reviewed in a timely manner.
    - Follow up with other team members as needed.
- Facilitate a process of selecting GSoC students and projects once final applications are in.
    - e.g. see [this spreadsheet from last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SAgETOHvNnVf-MBUqe_WLbOLsl8qDax35DOukaUueO8/edit#gid=1794943298).
- Welcome all new community contributors and help them get started.
    - Help contributors resolve any issues they are having with local setup (on Matrix and GitHub)
    - Answer other questions from contributors on GitHub and Matrix
    - Coordinate with Anish, since he’s doing some of this too.
- Keep track of comments on new issues and assign issues to people when they ask.
    - The rest of the team and Pavish should mostly be doing this, but it’s good to keep an eye on it.
- Keep track of issues that have already been assigned and un-assign them after 7 days of inactivity.
    - Anish is doing this, but it’s good to keep an eye on this.
    - https://github.com/orgs/centerofci/projects/1/views/42 may be helpful, it sorts by last activity.
- Follow up on requests from GSoC (e.g. filling out forms about impact of GSoC on Mathesar), since it builds goodwill
- Ensure there are enough open issues for GSoC contributors to work on OR revise the applicant guide to remove the contribution requirement and come up with an alternate way to evaluate candidates (maybe have a standard backend and frontend task for everyone).
- Generally keep an eye on GSoC process efficiency and make improvements to processes or documentation as needed.
