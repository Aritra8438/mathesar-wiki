- **Roles**:
    - **Owner**: Ghislaine
    - **Helpers**: Brent, Kriti, Pavish
- **Status**: Draft
- **Problem**:

Our team needs a systematic way to manage user feedback and categorize it appropriately for easy access and reference. This would help us support new features and changes, as well as facilitate discussions on topics related to the feedback.

- **Outcome**:

- Process and tools will be in place to manage user feedback.
- User feedback will be appropriately categorized and tagged for easy retrieval and use.
- The user feedback will be regularly updated to ensure its relevance.
- Anyone on the team will be able to access and use the feedback for various purposes, such as supporting new features or changes, and starting discussions on relevant topics.
- The feedback will be operationalized, meaning that it will be actively used as an input to inform decision-making and product development, and incorporated into the team's processes.

- **Solution**:

### Setup a new HackMD team for User Feedback

Create a new HackMD team named "User Feedback" and use it to capture and categorize all feedback. Each feedback item will be documented in an individual note, tagged appropriately for easy retrieval and reference.

To ensure consistency, we will create templates for these notes that include necessary fields, such as the date of feedback, user's name, referenced issue or link, category and tags.
