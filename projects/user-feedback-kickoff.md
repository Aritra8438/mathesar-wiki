- User feedback will be appropriately categorized and tagged for easy retrieval and use.
- The user feedback will be regularly updated to ensure its relevance.
- Anyone on the team will be able to access and use the feedback for various purposes, such as supporting new features or changes, and starting discussions on relevant topics.
