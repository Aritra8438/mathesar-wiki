## Roles

- **Owner**: Ghislaine
  - **Helpers**: Brent, Kriti, Pavish
- **Status**: Draft
- **Problem**:

We need a process to manage and categorize user feedback for easy access and reference, which will help the team improve new and existing features.

We must also create templates for various feedback collection methods, identify and engage an initial group of users, and conduct calls and surveys to evaluate their effectiveness and overall impact on our product development.

## Outcome

- **Feedback Management**
  - Processes and tools are established to manage user feedback.
  - Feedback is categorized and tagged for easy access and reference.
  - Feedback is openly available to the team.
  
- **Templates and Methods**
  - Templates for emails are created to invite users to participate in calls and surveys.
  - Templates for surveys, calls, and other feedback collection methods are created to gather feedback.

- **User Engagement**
  - An initial group of users is identified, contacted, and engaged in providing feedback through surveys and calls.
  - Calls and surveys are conducted with users.

- **Evaluation and Improvement**
  - The effectiveness of calls and surveys is evaluated and improvements are made.

## Solution

### 1. Set up a User Feedback Management Tool

We will establish a HackMD team called "User Feedback" to streamline note creation and organization. This will provide a dedicated space for managing user feedback.

### 2. Develop Feedback Capture Templates

We will create templates for managing user feedback, calls, surveys, and email invitations, ensuring consistency and quality when gathering user feedback. These templates will be available within the HackMD "User Feedback" team.

### 3. Develop Email Templates

We will create templates for emails to invite users to participate in calls and surveys.

### 4. Identify and Engage Users for Feedback Collection

We will identify an initial group of users, compile a list, and reach out to them using our email templates. We will ask them to participate in calls and surveys.

### 5. Schedule and Conduct Calls and Surveys

We will schedule calls with users who are interested in participating and distribute surveys to users who are not available for calls.

### 6. Analyze and Categorize Survey Answers and Calls

We will determine how to incorporate the notes and answers from surveys into our "User Feedback" collection, ensuring that feedback is properly categorized and accessible to the team.

### 7. Evaluate and Improve Feedback Collection Methods

We will evaluate the effectiveness of calls and surveys and make improvements to the process.
Some questions to consider:

- Is the feedback we are collecting useful?
- Do we need to make changes to the survey or call templates?
- Are we interacting with the right users?
