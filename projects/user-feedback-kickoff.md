## Roles
- **Owner**: Ghislaine
    - **Helpers**: Brent, Kriti, Pavish
- **Status**: Draft
- **Problem**:

Our team needs a systematic way to manage user feedback and categorize it appropriately for easy access and reference. This would help us support new features and changes, as well as facilitate discussions on topics related to the feedback.

Additionally, we need templates for surveys, calls and other means of obtaining feedback.

## Outcome

- Process and tools will be in place to manage user feedback.
- User feedback will be appropriately categorized and tagged for easy retrieval and use.
- The user feedback will be regularly updated to ensure its relevance.
- Anyone on the team will be able to access and use the feedback for various purposes, such as supporting new features or changes, and starting discussions on relevant topics.

## Solution

### Setup a new HackMD team for User Feedback

To better manage user feedback, we'll establish a HackMD team called "User Feedback," streamlining note creation and organization with YAML attributes for categorization.

HackMD's versatility, Markdown support, and table view mode make content management and review convenient, while enabling easy transfer to other platforms if needed.

We'll initiate the "User Feedback" team and document each feedback item in separate notes with relevant tags.

### Create feedback capture templates

We will develop a template to maintain consistency and organization in managing user feedback. The template will include fields such as feedback date, user's name, referenced issue or link, category, and tags.

These templates will be available within the HackMD "User Feedback" team.

### Create template for calls

A template incorporating questions and topics to be addressed by users during calls will be created.

### Create surveys for users

We will develop surveys for users to provide valuable feedback when they reach out to us. A standard set of questions will ensure we get quality feedback.

An additional tool might be needed in order to send the surveys and a process to categorize the answers.

### Categorize survey answers and calls within the "User Feedback" project

We need to determine how the notes and answers from surveys will be incorporated into our "User Feedback" collection.
