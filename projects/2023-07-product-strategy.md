**Name**: 2023-07 product strategy
**Status**: In review

## Problem
We need a strategy to help us decide what Mathesar's product roadmap should be. We should have a clear idea of where we're headed, what features are important for us to build, and how our product work will help us achieve our goals of user growth and sustainability.

## Solution
We need to understand:
- The kinds of problems that Mathesar is best suited to solve.
- What our users are missing or struggling with and how to improve our product to meet their needs.
- What kinds of features will expand the use cases that Mathesar can be used for.

### Tasks
As part of the project, we'll be doing some of the following:
- Research and categorization of user feedback and problems
- Ideation (forming hypotheses) and discussion with the team
- Talking to users or potential users if we can
- Developing personas ans strategy documents (see "Outcome" below)

## Outcome
At the end of this project, we expect to have:
- A set of user personas / use cases that we're targeting.
- A strategy document that outlines user needs and product priorities.
- A framework that can help us make feature development decisions quickly.
  - This includes a plan for ongoing user research and how it will be integrated into our roadmap planning.

## Risks
- Paying for all these pizzas will cost money.
- Users could be allergic to pizza ingredients.

## Resources
> This section collects project related resources. It's expected that there might not be anything here until the project plan is approved, and this section will grow over the project's timeframe.
